# Welcome to My ZMK Corne Layout

Hey there! This is the ZMK configuration for my daily driver Corne keyboard layout. It's a compact 42-key split keyboard (21 keys per side, 6x3 for fingers and 3 for thumb) that I've customized to fit my needs. This is a German (DE) layout, featuring umlauts and specific keys like DE_Y instead of the original.

## Features

- Based on my Moonlander layout called "Cornemak", which you can check out [here](https://configure.zsa.io/my_layout/view/O59Yq)
- Customized Colemak layout for comfy typing and smooth finger movements
- Uses layers and home row mods for easy access to all functions
- Inspired by the awesome [Miryoku layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku)
- German-specific keys and characters integrated into the layout
- Extensive use of combos for enhanced functionality

## Limitations

Just a heads up - this ZMK implementation doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the original Oryx config. Specifically:

- Mouse emulation isn't fully supported in ZMK yet, but there's hope on the horizon!

If you're curious about the status of mouse emulation in ZMK, check out the [official docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors/mouse-emulation). There's a promising PR for mouse move mode that's awaiting merge into the upstream ZMK firmware. You can track its progress [here](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2027).

Feel free to poke around, use, or tweak this layout for your own Corne keyboard. Happy typing! ðŸš€
